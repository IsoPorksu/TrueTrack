# This repository contains at least 4 files, all of which have different purposes.

**TrueTrack.py is probably what you have come here for.** It uses a large list of co-ordinates (contained with metro_coords.json) to determine the exact position, track and destination of each train and give it a rough ETA at the next station.
**To get TrueTrack.py up and running, simply pop it and metro_coords.json into a folder together and run TrueTrack.py.**

Metro.py is the primitive version of TrueTrack. It runs off a hand-complied list of GPS co-ordinates for each station and is significantly less accurate, especially for M2 services, where departure-specific information, such as destination and departure time, is highly unreliable. It also cannot locate trains that are currently not within 200m of a station, so you have to wait until they arrive at their next station before their location appears.
To get Metro.py up and running, simply run it!

MatterHard.py is not intended for non-dev use. Its sole purpose is to automatically collect co-ordinates from the system by following a specific car and dumping its co-ordinates into a JSON file.

Any other files are simply unedited lists of spare or extra co-ordinates generated by MatterHard.py, to be used to supplement metro_coords.json as and when required.


### Required packages:
* paho-mqtt
* pytz (for TruTrack.py only)
